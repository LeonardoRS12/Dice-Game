# Dice-Game
This is the repository for the project in Itransition Intern program,the project its a generalized dice game,wich allows you to play with 3 dices with different values.

The game is simple, you put 3 different dices with 6 different values (only integers)
this allows you to play the game with the computer, the computer show you the secret key,and also shows you the HMAC.

I used different libraries and modules to make this project:

-crypto: The node:crypto module provides cryptographic functionality that includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, and verify functions.

-readline: The node:readline module provides an interface for reading data from a Readable stream (such as process.stdin) one line at a time.

-cli-table3: This utility allows you to render unicode-aided tables on the command line from your node.js scripts.

cli-table3 is based on (and api compatible with) the original cli-table, and cli-table2, which are both unmaintained. cli-table3 includes all the additional features from cli-table2.

-chalk: Chalk module in Node.js is the third-party module that is used for styling the format of text and allows us to create our own themes in the node.js project.

Advantages of Chalk Module:
    1.-It helps to customize the color of the output of the command-line output
    2.-It helps to improve the quality of the output by providing several color options like for warning message red color and many more.
